## Week 2:  Introduction to randomness and sound art

### Sound art and computer music

Computers are cool for crunching numbers.

Computers were first used to control other musical instruments.

Computers are cool because the

## Fourier transform

Fourier was so cool that at first it wasn't believed.

Fourier theorem/corollary

Any sound can be synthesized

Importance of sine wave: frequency, amplitude, phase

Sine waves as building blocks of any sound.

Sine waves are cool because they can be identified without ambiguity with just 3 parameters:

* Frequency
* Aamplitude
* Phase

### Psychoacoustics

Psychoacoustics studies how humans perceive sound.

The physical parameters of sound waves are correlated with perceptual parameters:

|Physical world|Human perception|
|Frequency     |Pitch           |
|Amplitude     |Volume          |
|Phase         |None            |


Importance of computers to be able to synthesize any sound

### Human sound perception

Psychoacoustics

Experiment with sine waves, max frequency hearing range, TODO, link to Youtube.

Linear vs logarithm and exponentials.

Practical application: faders in mixing consoles

### Pure Data environment

Miller Puckette

Free libre open-source

Max MSP relationship.

### Oscillators

Common waveforms: sine, triangle, square, sawtooth

Common control parameters: amplitude, frequency.

### Noise

random object in Pure Data

### Sequencers

Korg SQ-1

Make Noise René: cartesian
