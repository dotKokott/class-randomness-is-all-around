## Week 2:  Introduction to randomness and sound art

### Sound art and computer music

Fourier transform

Importance of sine wave: frequency, amplitude, phase

Sine waves as building blocks of any sound

Importance of computers to be able to synthesize any sound

### Human sound perception

Psychoacoustics

Experiment with sine waves, max frequency hearing range

Linear vs logarithm and exponential

Practical application: faders in mixing consoles

### Pure Data environment

Miller Puckette

Free libre open-source

Max MSP

### Oscillators

Common waveforms: sine, triangle, square, sawtooth

### Noise

random object in Pure Data

### Sequencers

Korg SQ-1

Make Noise Ren√©: cartesian


### Sampling

Use of samples

Akai MPC

Add patch for samples
