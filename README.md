# class-randomness-is-all-around

## About

*Randomness is all around* is a class by [Aar√≥n Montoya-Moraga](http://montoyamoraga.io/).

*Randomness is all around* was taught at [School of Ma](http://schoolofma.org/), in an online non-presential way, over 4 weeks, one three-hour class every week, between Monday January 14th 2019 and Monday February 4th 2019.

## Description

Randomness is the lack of pattern and or predictability in patterns. Randomness is all around us and is what drives natural events such as the weather and dice-throwing. Randomness is behind noise, and noise is present in every sensor measurement, including our audiovisual perception of the world. Randomness is what makes vinyls sound different than digital audio and film look different than digital video.

Computers allows us to create mathematical models of randomness and incorporate to our art practice, rendering new exciting new generative and unpredictable artworks, like it has been done in genres such as [aleatoric music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleatoric_music) and [automatic drawing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrealist_automatism#Automatic_drawing), and by artists like [Lillian Schwartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lillian_Schwartz), [Max Hawkins](https://maxhawkins.me/) and [John Cage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cage), and featured by institutions such as the [Random Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_Institute).

We will cover math for randomness and probabilities, programming with scripts, programming audio synthesis and manipulation, computer graphics, video manipulation, and web concepts.

Applicants from diverse backgrounds, with varied skillsets and interests are welcome.

Don't feel discouraged if you know nothing about any of these topics, if you can use a computer you will be able to follow and learn in every class.

If you are an expert in any of these topics, you will learn how to incorporate other disciplines to your practice.

## Materials

The materials needed include:

* A computer running either Linux, MacOS, or Windows. (No tablets)
* Internet connection
* Headphones

## Technology

We will use free libre open source software, including:

* [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), for visual art and web apps.
* [Python3](https://www.python.org/), for math
* [Pure Data](http://puredata.info/), for audio and sound manipulation.
* [VidPy](https://antiboredom.github.io/vidpy/), for video manipulation.

## Methodology  

Each class includes explanations of theory and concepts, and practical examples with software.

Students are encouraged to ask questions and branch out from the proposed timeline for class.

All the notes and code written is included on this GitHub repository, so that students can focus on following along the coding examples and not worry about taking notes or missing out.

There are also several links for further reading and studying.

## Installation of tools

For this class we will be using the following applications, software and tools:

* [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/), software for editing audio. App installed is called "Audacity".
* [ChucK](http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/), software for computer music. App installed is an executable called "miniAudicle".
* [Command line interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface), environment for executing code. In Mac and Linux it is called "Terminal" and in Windows it is called "Command prompt".
* [Processing](https://processing.org/), software for programming interactive audiovisual applications. App installed is called "Processing".
* [Pure Data](http://puredata.info/), software for computer music. App installed is called "Pd-0.49-1".
* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/), programming language for general programming. To check if you have Python installed, open your "Command Line interface" and execute the command.
* [Text editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor), software to write code. Two options are recommended, [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/).

```
python
```

TODO: add more instructions

If you are on a Mac, Python2 is already installed in your computer. I recommend to install the package manager [homebrew](https://brew.sh) and then install Python3 with it via the command

```
brew install python3
```

## Week 1: Introduction to randomness and programming with Python

### Topics

* Randomness
* Randomness and computers
* Gaussian and uniform distributions
* Poisson and Markov chains
* Normalization of signals
* Python for math and randomness
* Randomness on the internet: random.org

### Notes

Today we will a text editor to write code using the language Python3, and will execute our scripts using the command-line interface.

Let's open our command-line interface and check that we have Python3 installed.

These are the results in my computer

```bash
python
```


```bash
python3
```

To exit, type the command

```bash
exit()
```
