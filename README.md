# class-randomness-is-all-around

## About

*Randomness is all around* is a class by [Aar√≥n Montoya-Moraga](http://montoyamoraga.io/).

*Randomness is all around* was taught at [School of Ma](http://schoolofma.org/), in an online non-presential way, over 4 weeks, one three-hour class every week, between Monday January 14th 2019 and Monday February 4th 2019.

### Code of conduct

This class is part of School of Ma, and will be ruled by their code of conduct.

## Description

Randomness is the lack of pattern and or predictability in patterns. Randomness is all around us and is what drives natural events such as the weather and dice-throwing. Randomness is behind noise, and noise is present in every sensor measurement, including our audiovisual perception of the world. Randomness is what makes vinyls sound different than digital audio and film look different than digital video.

Computers allows us to create mathematical models of randomness and incorporate to our art practice, rendering new exciting new generative and unpredictable artworks, like it has been done in genres such as [aleatoric music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleatoric_music) and [automatic drawing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrealist_automatism#Automatic_drawing), and by artists like [Lillian Schwartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lillian_Schwartz), [Max Hawkins](https://maxhawkins.me/) and [John Cage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cage), and featured by institutions such as the [Random Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_Institute).

We will cover math for randomness and probabilities, programming with scripts, programming audio synthesis and manipulation, computer graphics, video manipulation, and web concepts.

Applicants from diverse backgrounds, with varied skillsets and interests are welcome.

Don't feel discouraged if you know nothing about any of these topics, if you can use a computer you will be able to follow and learn in every class.

If you are an expert in any of these topics, you will learn how to incorporate other disciplines to your practice.

## Materials

The materials needed include:

* A computer running either Linux, MacOS, or Windows. (No tablets)
* Internet connection
* Headphones

## Technology

We will use free libre open source software, including:

* [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), for visual art and web apps.
* [Python3](https://www.python.org/), for math
* [Pure Data](http://puredata.info/), for audio and sound manipulation.
* [VidPy](https://antiboredom.github.io/vidpy/), for video manipulation.

## Methodology  

Each class includes explanations of theory and concepts, and practical examples with software.

Students are encouraged to ask questions and branch out from the proposed timeline for class.

All the notes and code written is included on this GitHub repository, so that students can focus on following along the coding examples and not worry about taking notes or missing out.

There are also several links for further reading and studying.

## Installation of tools

For this class we will be using the following applications, software and tools:

* [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/), software for editing audio. App installed is called "Audacity".
* [ChucK](http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/), software for computer music. App installed is an executable called "miniAudicle".
* [Command line interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface), environment for executing code. In Mac and Linux it is called "Terminal" and in Windows it is called "Command prompt".
* [Processing](https://processing.org/), software for programming interactive audiovisual applications. App installed is called "Processing".
* [Pure Data](http://puredata.info/), software for computer music. App installed is called "Pd-0.49-1".
* [Text editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor), software to write code. Two options are recommended, [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/).
* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/), programming language for general programming. To check if you have Python installed, open your "Command Line interface" and execute the command.
```bash
python
```


TODO: add more instructions

If you are on a Mac, Python2 is already installed in your computer. I recommend to install the package manager [homebrew](https://brew.sh) and then install Python3 with it via the command

```bash
brew install python3
```

## Week 1: Introduction to randomness and programming with Python

### Topics

* Randomness
* Randomness and computers
* Gaussian and uniform distributions
* Poisson and Markov chains
* Normalization of signals
* Python for math and randomness
* Randomness on the internet: random.org

### Week 1 notes

Today we will a text editor to write code using the language Python3, and will execute our scripts using the command-line interface.

Let's open our command-line interface and check that we have Python3 installed.

Execute this command

```bash
python
```

This is what I see on my computer.

![alt text](https://github.com/montoyamoraga/class-randomness-is-all-around/raw/master/pics/week1-python2-example.png "Python2 example")

In my computer, a Macbook running macOS, *python* is an alias for Python2.

If your computer shows Python3, then you are ready to go, and you will execute your code using the command *python*, yay.

To exit, execute the command

```bash
exit()
```

If *python* doesn't correspond to Python3, let's execute now the command python3.

```bash
python3
```

This is what I see on my computer, a Macbook running macOS.

![alt text](https://github.com/montoyamoraga/class-randomness-is-all-around/raw/master/pics/week1-python3-example.png "Python3 example")

If your computer shows Python3, then you are ready to go, and you will execute your code using the command *python3*, yay.

To exit, type the command

```bash
exit()
```

I managed to install Python3 and made it available using the commmand python3 on my computer by installing [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and then installing Python3 by executing the command

```bash
brew install python3
```

If you still haven't been able to use Python3 on your machine, either via the command *python* or *python3*, you need to both install it and then making it available from the terminal.

In Windows, I suggest using the installer from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/), and making sure that you select the option *Add Python 3.x to the PATH*. After installing I suggest restarting your Windows computer and checking if Python is accessible from the command-line.

Here are some additional [instructions for Windows](https://wsvincent.com/install-python3-windows/).

If you are running into trouble, contact the instructor of this class.

Let's start writing Python code.

Inside of the folder week1, create a file called script.py.

We will encourage good manners and good practices in programming, such as using comments to explain and document the code we are writing.

```python
# script.py
# written by X
# runs with Python3
# date: yyymmdd

# print message on console
print("testing")
```

Python can do math, but sometimes we will include libraries, which are snippets of code that other people wrote and that we can use. We can install them on our hard drive, but it is a lot of clutter and also it's easy to break things when all your Python scripts share their dependencies. We will use virtual environments instead, so that each project we write, will only use its own libraries, and not the ones that are installed globally in your computer. This is called scope limiting.

Let's setup our virtual environment yay.

Let's open the terminal and navigate to the folder of this class.

```bash
cd Desktop/class-randomness-is-all-around-master/
```

To check that we are in the right folder, list the contents of the terminal.

```bash
ls
```

Let's use week1 and navigate to this folder.

```bash
cd week1/
```

Create a virtual environment on it with Python3

```bash
python3 -m venv env
```

If it is successful, you should see a new folder called env/ inside of the folder week1/.

Now activate the virtual environment by executing the command.

```
source env/bin/activate
```

You should see *(env)* appear on your command-line.

We will the library [Tracery for Python](https://github.com/aparrish/pytracery) by [Allison Parrish](http://www.decontextualize.com/), a Python port of the original [Tracery](http://tracery.io/) by [Kate Compton](http://www.galaxykate.com/).

To install it we will use pip, by executing the following command.

```bash
pip install tracery
```
