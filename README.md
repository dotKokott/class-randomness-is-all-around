# class-randomness-for-multimedia-arts

## About

This is a class by [Aar√≥n Montoya-Moraga](http://montoyamoraga.io/).

It is taught in 4 weeks, one 2-hour class every week.

We will cover math for randomness and probabilities, programming with scripts, programming audio synthesis and manipulation, computer graphics, video manipulation, and web concepts.

Applicants from diverse backgrounds, with varied skillsets and interests are welcome. =

Don't feel discouraged if you know nothing about any of these topics, if you can use a computer you will be able to follow and learn in every class.

If you are an expert in any of these topics, you will learn how to incorporate other disciplines to your practice.

## Materials

The materials needed include:

* A computer running either Linux, MacOS, or Windows. (No tablets)
* Internet connection
* Headphones

## Technology

We will use free libre open source software, including:

* [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), for visual art and web apps.
* [Python3](https://www.python.org/), for math
* [Pure Data](http://puredata.info/), for audio and sound manipulation.
* [VidPy](https://antiboredom.github.io/vidpy/), for video manipulation.

## Methodology  

Each class includes explanations of theory and concepts, and practical examples with software.

Students are encouraged to ask questions and branch out from the proposed timeline for class.

All the notes and code written is included on this GitHub repository, so that students can focus on following along the coding examples and not worry about taking notes or missing out.

There are also several links for further reading and studying.
