# Installation

This document details the installation of software required for the class [Randomness is all around us](https://github.com/montoyamoraga/class-randomness-is-all-around) by [Aar√≥n Montoya-Moraga](http://montoyamoraga.io/).

## Python3

Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, notably using significant whitespace. It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales. (Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language))).



## Processing

Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts. Since 2001, Processing has promoted software literacy within the visual arts and visual literacy within technology. There are tens of thousands of students, artists, designers, researchers, and hobbyists who use Processing for learning and prototyping. (Source: [processing.org](https://processing.org/)).

* Go to [processing.org/](https://processing.org/).
* Go to the [Download section](https://processing.org/download/).
* Download the correct installer for your operating system, either Linux, Mac or Windows.
* Follow the instructions of the installer.
* The name of the application installed is *Processing*.

## ChucK

ChucK is a programming language for real-time sound synthesis and music creation. It is open-source and freely available on MacOS X, Windows, and Linux. ChucK presents a unique time-based, concurrent programming model that's precise and expressive (we call this strongly-timed), dynamic control rates, and the ability to add and modify code on-the-fly. In addition, ChucK supports MIDI, OpenSoundControl, HID device, and multi-channel audio. It's fun and easy to learn, and offers composers, researchers, and performers a powerful programming tool for building and experimenting with complex audio synthesis/analysis programs, and real-time interactive music.

* Go to [chuck.cs.princeton.edu/](http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/).
* Go to [download ChucK](http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/release/).
* Download the correct installer for your operating system, either Linux, Mac or Windows.
* Follow the instructions of the installer.
* The name of the application installed is *miniAudicle*.

## Pure Data

Pure Data (or just Pd) is an open source visual programming language for multimedia. Its main distribution (aka Pd Vanilla) is developed by Miller Puckette. (Source: [puredata.info/](http://puredata.info/)).

* Go to [puredata.info/](http://puredata.info/).
* Go to [Downloads](http://puredata.info/downloads).
* Go to [http://puredata.info/downloads/pure-data](http://puredata.info/downloads).
* Download the correct installer for your operating system, either Linux, Mac or Windows.
* Follow the instructions of the installer.
* The name of the application installed is *Pd-0.49-1*.

In Mac and Linux it is called "Terminal" and in Windows it is called "Command prompt".
App installed is called "Processing".

* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/), To check if you have Python installed, open your "Command Line interface" and execute the command.
```bash
python
```


TODO: add more instructions

If you are on a Mac, Python2 is already installed in your computer. I recommend to install the package manager [homebrew](https://brew.sh) and then install Python3 with it via the command

```bash
brew install python3
```
